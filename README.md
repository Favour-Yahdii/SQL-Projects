There were 930 returning guests in the dataset.
The busiest month for reservations was October.
Rooms where meal plans were chosen cost more, but not by a significant amount.

### Usage
This dataset can be used for various data analysis and visualization projects, as well as for building predictive models related to hotel reservations. Some potential areas of investigation include:

- Analyzing the relationship between the number of adults and children in each reservation and other variables such as lead time and cost.
- Investigating the factors that influence the popularity of the hotel at different times of the day and week.
- Building a model to predict the likelihood of a reservation being made by a returning guest based on various variables such as lead time and meal plan choice.

### Hotel Reservations Dataset Analysis
This repository contains the steps taken to analyze a hotel reservations dataset. The dataset includes information about the number of adults and children in each reservation, the lead time, and whether a meal plan was chosen.

### Data Preparation
Load the dataset into a data analysis tool in this case SQL.
Perform a preliminary exploration of the data to check for missing values and duplicates.
Clean the data as necessary to ensure that it is in a format suitable for analysis.


### Results
The results of the analysis will be presented in a written report and/or a set of data visualizations. Some findings from the analysis include:

- Insights into the characteristics of the hotel's guests and their reservation patterns.
- Trends and patterns in the data related to the lead time, meal plan choice, and other variables.

### Conclusion
The hotel reservations dataset analysis provides valuable insights into the operations of the hotel and can be used to inform business decisions related to pricing, marketing, and resource allocation. By using the results of this analysis, the hotel can better understand its customers and make informed decisions that improve the guest experience and drive business growth.
